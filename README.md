I'm Grace from Indonesian. I'm a bachelor's degree student majoring in Information Systems. I'm enthusiastic about Software Engineering. I thoroughly enjoy learning the C and Java programming languages through various case studies summarized in my coursework assignments. By applying learning concepts such as data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and database management, I have found great satisfaction in my studies.
